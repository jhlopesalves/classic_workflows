John Ames is a preacher, the son of a preacher and the grandson (both maternal and paternal) of preachers. It’s 1956 in Gilead, Iowa, towards the end of the Reverend Ames’s life, and he is absorbed in recording his family’s story, a legacy for the young son he will never see grow up. Haunted by his grandfather’s presence, John tells of the rift between his grandfather and his father: the elder, an angry visionary who fought for the abolitionist cause, and his son, an ardent pacifist. He is troubled, too, by his prodigal namesake, Jack (John Ames) Boughton, his best friend’s lost son who returns to Gilead searching for forgiveness and redemption. Told in John Ames’s joyous, rambling voice that finds beauty, humour and truth in the smallest of life’s details, Gilead is a song of celebration and acceptance of the best and the worst the world has to offer. At its heart is a tale of the sacred bonds between fathers and sons, pitch-perfect in style and story, set to dazzle critics and readers alike.",

    "## Experimental Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The core objective is comparative, not absolute performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to evaluate whether a pipeline built with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* structured exploratory data analysis (EDA),\n",
    "* careful text cleaning,\n",
    "* feature engineering,\n",
    "* and scikit-learn classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "can achieve **higher predictive accuracy and stability** than a general-purpose zero-shot model operating without task-specific training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modelling Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook follows a deliberately *non-LLM* approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The emphasis is on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* interpretability,\n",
    "* reproducibility,\n",
    "* computational efficiency,\n",
    "* and explicit control over features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of prompting intelligence, we engineer it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-Level Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow follows a classical supervised NLP structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset ingestion and inspection**\n",
    "   Understanding label distribution, text quality, and noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text normalisation and preprocessing**\n",
    "   Removing artefacts that introduce semantic distortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature representation**\n",
    "   Vectorisation using TF-IDF and related statistical encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model training**\n",
    "   Linear and probabilistic classifiers trained on labelled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation against the zero-shot baseline**\n",
    "   Direct performance comparison under equivalent conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot classifiers are powerful — but they are also:\n",
    "\n",
    "* expensive,\n",
    "* opaque,\n",
    "* and often suboptimal for fixed-domain problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment explores a pragmatic question relevant to real production systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "When does *engineering* beat *prompting*?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, next we can tighten this even further by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* adding an explicit **research question block** (almost paper-like),\n",
    "* formalising the **evaluation metric assumptions**,\n",
    "* or writing a short **“threats to validity”** paragraph — which would push this notebook into near-academic clarity without becoming pretentious.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is already very much your style: precise, intentional, and method-driven.\n"
